This was the final project of the machine learning course, which includes two parts.


## First Part: Implementing a CNN from scratch!

In this part we should implement the simple CNN structure for doing Grayscale, Sobel X, Sobel Y, Gaussian Blur functionalities.

## Second Part: Neural Style Transfer

In this part, we are going to implement a famous technique in the field of _Computer Vision_ called __Neural Style Transfer__. This technique is used to apply the style of a specific image to another image. For example, you can apply the style of a famous painting to your photo! Let's get started!

Here is the Style image.
